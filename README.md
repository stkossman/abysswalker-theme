# Abysswalker Theme

**Abysswalker** is a minimalist dark theme designed for deep focus.

It strips away syntax highlighting noise, leaving only what matters: structure, logic, and components.

## Features

* **Void Background:** Deep grey (`#1a1a1a`) integration for a borderless feel.
* **Frontend Focused:** Special highlighting for React components and JSX.

## Recommended Settings

To get the full **Abysswalker** experience, add these settings to your `settings.json`. 
This theme pairs perfectly with the **Geist Mono** font.

```json
{
	"editor.fontFamily": "'Geist Mono', 'Consolas', monospace",
	"editor.fontLigatures": true,
}
